 If in this directory (Herwig++/Doc) you find the Doxygen
 configuration file, refman.conf, that allows to build the
 Doxygen documentation for Herwig++. This configuration file
 uses another two files:
  
   1)  refmanThePEG.conf : the Doxygen configuration file
                           used by ThePEG. This has been
       copied directly from ThePEG/ThePEG/Doc/refman.conf
       (and then renamed refmanThePEG.conf).
       In future, it is better to eliminate this file, and
       refer directly to ThePEG/ThePEG/Doc/refman.conf .

   2)  tagfileThePEG.tag : a special Doxygen file which allows
                           to link to the ThePEG's Doxygen
       documentation kept in Lund.
       This file should be updated with the new ThePEG 
       releases (it can be generated by executing  make doc
       in ThePEG and then renaming ThePEG-refman.tag as
       tagfileThePEG.tag).

 To generate the Doxygen documentation for Herwig++ you have
 two possibilities:

   a)  make doc                     : either in Herwig++/  
                                          or in Herwig++/Doc

   b)  doxygen refman.conf          : in Herwig++/Doc
                            
 This produced the following:

   i) The subdirectory  refman-html/  which contains the HTML
      version of the documentation: you can see it by pointing
      your browser to:

         file:///your-path/Herwig++/Doc/refman-html/index.html

  ii) The subdirectory  refman-latex/  which contains the Latex
      stuff of the documentation: you can get a .ps file by doing:
         
         cd refman-latex
         make ps

      which produces the file  refman.ps .

 iii) The file Herwig++-refman.tag, which can be used for the
      Doxygen documentation of any other project that uses
      Herwig++ and want to link to the Herwig++'s Doxygen
      documentation.
