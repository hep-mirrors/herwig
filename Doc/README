 If in this directory (Herwig++/Doc) the .html files already exist,
 and are updated, then simply open:

     file:///your-path/Herwig++/Doc/main.html

 with your browser, to see the list of all Herwig++ classes,
 organized according to the Herwig++/ subdirectory where they are
 defined. You can then navigate them, following the links.
 
 If you need instead to create or update the .html files, then you
 have to run first: 

 $ dohtml.pl

 ( which is a Perl script that must be executed in the same directory 
   (Herwig++/Doc). This script calls the awk script h2html.awk, that 
   has been copied from Pythia7/Doc ).

 N.B. there is no link to Pythia7 classes.
