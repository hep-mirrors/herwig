Validation
==========

Runs for the process :math:`pp \to t\bar{t}` at next-to-leading order with a given number of 50 million events which were split up into a different number of parallel jobs were run and combined with Herwig-parallel and then compared to a large single standalone run also containing 50 million events.

In the following plots runs with

- 1 job with 50 million events
- 10 jobs with 5 million events each
- 100 jobs with 500000 events each and
- 500 jobs with 100000 events each

are compared. There is perfect agreement within the margins given by the statistical errors.
