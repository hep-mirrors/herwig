This module is designed to provide an interface to the AcerDet fast detector simulation.
The following points need to be noted.

1. There is a bug in AcerDets ACDHERWIG6 routine which requires the line
      N=NHEP
   added after the declarations at the top of the routine and before
      DO 180 I=1,N

2. AcerDet compiles with gfortran but due to the compiler options doesn't
   initialise certain variables which therefore give garbage for the jet flavours.
   Therefore to avoid problems Herwig++ must be configured using FC=g77

3. You will need to specific the locations of both ACERDET and CERNLIB in the Makefile.
