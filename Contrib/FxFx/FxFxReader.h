/**
 * FxFxReader is an abstract base class to be used for objects
 * which reads event files or streams from matrix element
 * generators. Derived classes must at least implement the open() and
 * doReadEvent() methods to read in information about the whole run into
 * the HEPRUP variable and next event into the HEPEUP variable
 * respectively. Also the close() function to close the file or stream
 * read must be implemented. Although these functions are named as if
 * we are reading from event files, they could just as well implement
 * the actual generation of events.
 *
 * After filling the HEPRUP and HEPEUP variables, which are protected
 * and easily accesible from the sub-class, this base class will then
 * be responsible for transforming this data to the ThePEG Event
 * record in the getEvent() method. <code>FxFxReader</code>s can
 * only be used inside FxFxEventHandler objects.
 *
 * In the initialization the virtual open() and scan() functions are
 * called. Here the derived class must provide the information about
 * the processes in the variables corresponding to the HEPRUP common
 * block. Note that the IDWTUP is required to be +/- 1, and sub
 * classes are required to change the information accordingly to
 * ensure the correct corss section sampling. Note also that the
 * controlling FxFxEventHandler may choose to generate weighted
 * events even if IDWTUP is 1.
 *
 * Note that the information given per process in e.g. the XSECUP and
 * XMAXUP vectors is not used by the FxFxEventHandler and by
 * default the FxFxReader is not assumed to be able to actively
 * choose between the sub-processes. Instead, the
 * FxFxEventHandler can handle several FxFxReader objects
 * and choose between them. However, a sub-class of FxFxReader
 * may set the flag isActive, in which case it is assumed to be able
 * to select between its sub-processes itself.
 *
 * The FxFxReader may be assigned a number ReweightBase objects
 * which either completely reweights the events produced (in the
 * reweights vector), or only biases the selection without influencing
 * the cross section (in the preweights vector). Note that it is the
 * responsibility of a sub-class to call the reweight() function and
 * multiply the weight according to its return value (typically done
 * in the readEvent() function).
 *
 * @see \ref FxFxReaderInterfaces "The interfaces"
 * defined for FxFxReader.
