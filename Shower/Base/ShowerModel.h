/** \ingroup Shower
 *
 *  The ShowerModel class is a container for all the objects needed to implement a
 *  specific model of the shower evolution, as opposed to those which are independent
 *  of the evolution.
 *
 *  In general there are four types of object 
 * - The KinematicsReconstructor object which is responsible for reconstruction
 *   of the shower kinematics after the evolution.
 * - The PartnerFinder which is responsible for finding the partner and setting the
 *   initial evolution scale
 * - A vector of SudakovFormFactor objects which will usually all be instances
 *   of a class implementing the SudakovFormFactor for a specific model with
 *   different splitting functions for different branchings
 *
 *  For each model the checkConsistency member must be implemented to check that
 *  the correct objects for the model are used.
 *
 * @see \ref ShowerModelInterfaces "The interfaces"
 * defined for ShowerModel.
