/*! \ingroup Hadronization
 *  \class ClusterFinder
 *  \brief This class forms clusters from the partons produced in the Shower.
 *  \author Philip Stephens
 *  \author Alberto Ribon
 * 
 *  This class scans through the particles in the event and produces a 
 *  collection of clusters, defined as a colour-singlet combinations of 
 *  colour-connected particles. There are no assumptions about the type 
 *  (i.e. quark or diquark) or number of the component particles of the 
 *  cluster; however, most of the time clusters are formed by quark-antiquark 
 *  pairs. In special situations, such as baryon-violating processes in
 *  R-nonconserved Susy, three quarks (or three antiquarks) could form a 
 *  cluster. Because at the moment we don't know how to handle 3-component 
 *  clusters (i.e. how to fission heavy ones, or how to decay clusters), we 
 *  provide also a separate method, reduceToTwoComponents, which 
 *  does the job of redefining these 3-component clusters as "normal" 
 *  2-component ones, simply by randomly considering two (anti-) quarks as a 
 *  (anti-) diquark. Notice that if in the future the method 
 *  reduceToTwoComponents is modified or even eliminated, the 
 *  main method for finding clusters, formClusters, will not need 
 *  any change. 
 *
 * @see \ref ClusterFinderInterfaces "The interfaces"
 * defined for ClusterFinder.
