This subdirectory is based on version 2.6 of the Looptools package available at
http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/

From their website, it seems that Looptools is licensed under the LGPL, 
although the tarball itself does not contain a reference to it.

For reference, we have added the LGPL in the file COPYING.Looptools.
Note that this licence only applies to the Looptools subdirectory.

Our changes to LoopTools-2.6.tar.gz are listed here:

* removed unused 'tools' and 'frontend' directories
* include/clooptools.h modified: definitions and 'extern' declarations moved to 
  Herwig's clooptools.cc
* fixed 64bit int -> long problem in cache.c
* added Makefile.am; creates libHwLooptools.la to be linked into Herwig.so
* added tester.cc: a quick test whether c++ linking works
