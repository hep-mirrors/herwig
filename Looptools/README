This subdirectory is based on version 2.2 of the Looptools package available at
http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/

From their website, it seems that Looptools is licensed under the LGPL, 
although the tarball itself does not contain a reference to it.

For reference, we have added the LGPL in the file COPYING.Looptools.
Note that this licence only applies to the Looptools subdirectory.

Our changes to LoopTools-2.2.tar.gz are listed here:

* include/clooptools.h modified
* added Makefile.am; creates libHwLooptools.a
* added tester.cc: a quick test whether c++ linking works
