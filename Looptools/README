This subdirectory is based on the Looptools package available at
http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/ 

From their website, it seems that Looptools is licensed under the LGPL, 
although the tarball itself does not contain a reference to it.

For reference, we have added the LGPL in the file COPYING.Looptools.
Note that this licence only applies to the Looptools subdirectory.

Our changes to LoopTools21.tar.gz are listed here:

* include/clooptools.h completely rewritten
* added Makefile.am; creates libHwLooptools.so
* not compiling ff/ffcb2.f ; breaks with undefined symbols
* added tester.cc: a quick test whether c++ linking works
