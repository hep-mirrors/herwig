# QCD and QED radiation in the showering process.

# If the old YFS formalism is required we have to insert the QEDRadiationHandler

# And to prevent double-counting we also need to remove emissions from leptons.
# Note that YFS here only adds photon radiation if the decaying particle is a W/Z boson.
