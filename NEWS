Herwig++ News				(emacs -*- outline -*- format)

* Herwig++-2.5.1 release: 2011-06-24 (tagged at SVN r6609)

** Example input files at 7 TeV
   All our example input files for LHC now have their beam energy set
   to 7 TeV instead of 14 TeV.

** Colour reconnection on by default
   The colour reconnection tunes are now the default setup. Version 2
   of the tunes replaces the *-1 tunes, which had a problem with LEP
   event shapes.

** Run name tags
   Aded possibility to add a tag to the run name when running with the
   '-t' option. One run file can thus be run with different seeds and
   results stored in different output files.

** Floating point exceptions
   The new command line option -D enables floating point error checking.

** General improvements to WeakCurrent decays

** Remnant decayer
   Hardwired gluon mass was removed.

** WeakCurrentDecayConstructor
   Instead of specifying separate Particle1...Particle5 vectors for
   the decay modes, the new interface DecayModes can be filled with
   decay tags in the standard syntax.

** BSM: improvements to handling of vertex and model initialisation

** Powheg Higgs
   Option to use pT or mT as the scale in alphaS and for the
   factorization scale in the PDFs

** Ticket #337: Tau polarization wrong in charged Higgs decay

** Ticket #339: Colour flows in GeneralThreeBody Decayers for 3bar -> 8 3bar 1

** Ticket #340: Crash for resonant zero-width particles

** Ticket #341: Varying scale for BSM processes
   The scale used is now ResonantProcessConstructor:ScaleFactor or
   TwoToTwoProcessConstructor:ScaleFactor multiplied by sHat.

** Ticket #346: Chargino decays
   Chargino decayers now automatically switch between the mesonic
   decays for mass differences less than 2 GeV and the normal partonic
   decays above 2 GeV.

** Ticket #349: Stop by default on input file errors
   The '--exitonerror' flag is now the default behaviour for the
   Herwig++ binary. To switch back to the old behaviour,
   '--noexitonerror' is required.

** Ticket #351: Four-body stop decays

** Tested with gcc-4.6



* Herwig++-2.5.0 release: 2011-02-08 (tagged at SVN r6274)

** Uses ThePEG-1.7.0
   Herwig++ 2.5.0 requires ThePEG 1.7.0 to benefit from various
   improvements, particularly: handling of diffractive processes;
   respecting LD_LIBRARY_PATH when loading dynamic libraries,
   including LHAPDF; improvements to repository commands for decay
   modes. See ThePEG's NEWS file for more details.

** POWHEG improvements

*** New POWHEG processes
    Simulation at NLO accuracy using the POWHEG method is now
    available for hadronic diboson production (pp to WW,WZ,ZZ), Higgs
    decays to heavy quarks, and e+e- to two jets or ttbar, including
    full mass dependence.

*** Input file changes
    The input files for setting up POWHEG process simulation have been
    simplified.  See the example files LHC-Powheg.in and TVT-Powheg.in
    for the improved command list.

*** Structural changes
    The POWHEG backend in the shower code has been restructured to
    make future additions easier: PowhegEvolver has merged with
    Evolver; both the matrix element corrections and real corrections
    in the POWHEG scheme are implemented directly in the ME or Decayer
    classes.

** New processes at leading order

*** Photon initiated processes
    We have added a matrix element for dijet production in gamma
    hadron collisions.
    
*** Bottom and charm in heavy quark ME
    The option of bottom and charm quarks is now supported for heavy
    quark production in MEHeavyQuark.

** Colour reconnection
   The cluster hadronization model has been extended by an option to
   reconnect coloured constituents between clusters with a given
   probability. This new model is different from the colour
   reconnection model used in FORTRAN HERWIG, and improves the
   description of minimum bias and underlying event data.

** Diffractive Processes
   Both single and double diffractive processes are now supported in
   Herwig++. The Pomeron PDF is implemented using a fit to HERA data,
   and a pion PDF can be used to model reggeon flux.

** BSM physics

*** New models 
    We have added new BSM models, particularly ADD-type extra
    dimension models and the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard
    model (NMSSM).  Effects of leptoquarks can as well be simulated.

*** Vertex additions
    We have added flavour changing stop interactions (stop -
    neutralino - charm) and gravitino interactions with particular
    emphasis on numerical stability for very light gravitinos.
    Tri-linear Higgs and Higgs-Higgs/Vector-Vector four-vertices are
    available as well.

*** Input file changes
    The SUSY model can now also extract the SLHA information from the
    header of a Les Houches event file: replace the SLHA file name
    in the example input files with the LH file name.

*** Structure
    The backend structure of the HardProcessConstructor has changed,
    to allow easier inclusion of new process constructors. Some 2->3
    BSM scattering processes involving neutral higgs bosons are now
    included. The spin handling has been improved in the background. 

** Shower splitting code reorganized
   The selection of spin structures has been decoupled from the choice
   of colour structure. This gives more flexibility in implementing
   new splittings. Selected splittings can be disabled in the input
   files.

** B mixing
   B mixing, and indirect CP violation in the B meson system are
   included now.
   
** Looptools
   The Looptools directory has been updated to reflect T.Hahn's
   Looptools 2.6.

** Contrib changes
   The ROOT interface has been removed as deprecated. The MCPWNLO code
   has temporarily been removed from the Contrib directory as a major
   review of this code is required. Additionally, there are various
   fixes to all other codes shipped in Contrib.

** DIS improvements
   The momentum reshuffling in DIS events has been improved.

** mu and nu beams
   mu, nu_e and nu_mu and their antiparticles are now available as
   beam particles. They are all supported in the DIS matrix
   elements. mu+ mu- collisions are supported in the general
   matrix element code for BSM models, but not yet in the hard-coded
   matrix elements for lepton-lepton scattering.

** Structural changes

*** Inline code
    Inline code has been merged into the header files, .icc files were
    removed.

*** Silent build
    By default, Herwig++ now builds with silent build rules. To get
    the old behaviour, run 'make V=1'.

*** Debug level
    The debug level on the command line will now always have priority.

*** Event counter
    The event counter has been simplified.

*** Interpolator persistency
    Interpolators can now be written persistently.

** Ticket #307: Momentum violation check in BasicConsistency
   Added parameters AbsoluteMomentumTolerance and
   RelativeMomentumTolerance

** Example POWHEG input files
   The example input files for Powheg processes now set the NLO
   alpha_S correctly, and are run as part of 'make check'.

** Truncated shower
   A problem which lead to the truncated shower not being applied in
   some cases has been fixed.

** Fixes to numerical problems
   Minor problems with values close to zero were fixed in several
   locations.

** Remove duplicated calculation of event shapes
   An accidental duplication in the calculation of event shapes was
   removed, they are now only calculated once per event. Several other
   minor issues in the event shape calculations have also been fixed.

** MRST PDFs fixed
   An initialization problem in the internal MRST PDFs was fixed.

** Vertex scale choice
   The scale in the Vertex classes can now be zero where
   possible.

** Treatment of -N flag
   The Herwig++ main program now correctly treats the -N flag
   as optional.

** Numerical stability improved
   The numerical stability in the 'RunningMass' and
   'QTildeReconstructor' classes has been improved.  The
   stability of the boosts in the SOPTHY code for the
   simulation of QED radiation has been improved.
   The accuracy of boosts in the z-direction has been improved to
   fix problems with extremely high p_T partons.

** Bugfix in initial state splittings
   A bug in the implementation of the PDF weight in initial-state
   qbar -> qbar g  splittings has been fixed.

** Bugfix in chargino neutralino vertices
   A bug in the 'chi+- chi0 W-+' and charged
   Higgs-sfermions vertices has been fixed.

** Remove uninitialized variables written to repository
   A number of uninitialised variables which were written to the
   repository have been initialised to zero to avoid problems on some
   systems.

** Fix to QED radiation in hadronic collisions
   The longitudinal boost of the centre-of-mass frame in hadronic
   collisions is correctly accounted for now in the generation of QED
   radiation.

** Fix to numerical problems in two-body decays
   Numerical problems have been fixed, which appeared in the rare case
   that the three-momenta of the decay products in two-body decays are
   zero in the rest frame of the decay particle.

** A problem with forced splittings in the Remnant was fixed.

** ME correction for W+- decays applied properly
   The matrix element correction for QCD radiation in W+- decays
   which was not being applied is now correctly used.

** Top quark decays from SLHA file
   The presence of top quark decay modes in SLHA files is now handled
   correctly.

** Exceptional shower reconstruction kinematics
   Additional protection against problems due to the shower
   reconstruction leading to partons with x>1 has been added.

** Ordering of particles in BSM processes
   Changes have been made to allow arbitrary ordering of the outgoing
   particles in BSM processes.

** Bugfixes in tau decays
   Two bugs involving tau decays have been fixed. The wrong masses
   were used in the 'KPiCurrent' class for the scalar form factors
   and a mistake in the selection of decay products lead to
   tau- --> pi0 K- being generated instead of tau- --> eta K-.

** Avoid crashes in baryon number violating processes.
   To avoid crashes, better protection has been introduced for the
   case where diquarks cannot be formed from the quarks in a
   baryon-number violating process. In addition, the parents of the
   baryon-number violating clusters have been changed to avoid
   problems with the conversion of the events to HepMC.

** QED radiation in W- decays
   A bug in the 'QEDRadiationHandler' class which resulted
   in no QED radiation being generated in W- decays has been fixed.

** A number of minor fixes to the SUSY models have been made.

** Partial width calculations in BSM models  
   A fix for the direction of the incoming particle in the calculation
   of two-body partial widths in BSM models has been made.

** LoopTools improvements   
   The LoopTools cache is now cleared more frequently to
   reduce the amount of memory used by the particle.

** Negative gluino masses are now correctly handled.

** A problem with mixing matrices which are not square has been fixed. 

** Removed duplicate diagram
   The 'MEee2gZ2ll' class has been fixed to only include the
   photon exchange diagram once rather than twice as previously.

** Fix for duplicate particles in DecayConstructor
   A problem has been fixed which occurred if the same particle was
   included in the list of DecayConstructor:DecayParticles.

** Fixes for UED model vertices
   A number of minor problems in the vertices for the UED model have
   been fixed.

** Include missing symmetry factor
   The missing identical-particle symmetry factor in
   'MEPP2GammaGamma' has been included.

** Fix floating point problem in top decays
   A floating point problem in the matrix element correction for top
   decays has been fixed.



* Herwig++-2.4.2 release: 2009-12-11 (tagged at SVN r5022)

** Ticket #292: Tau decay numerical instability
   The momentum assignment in tau decays contained numerical
   instabilities which have been fixed by postponing the tau decay
   until after the parton shower. A new interface setting
   DecayHandler:Excluded is available to prevent decays in the shower
   step. This is enabled by default for tau only.

** Ticket #290: Missing MSSM colour structure
   The missing colour structure for gluino -> gluon neutralino was added.

** Ticket #294: Zero momentum in some decays
   Some rare phase space points lead to zero momentum in two-body
   decays. This has been fixed.

** Ticket #295: Stability of QED radiation for lepton collider processes
   The numerical stability of QED radiation momenta was improved
   further.

** Ticket #296: K0 oscillation vertex was wrong
   The oscillation from K0 to K0_L/S now takes place at the production
   vertex of K0.

** Ticket #289: Undefined variables in repository
   On some system configurations, undefined variables were written to
   the repository. These have been fixed.

** Fixed QED radiation for hadron processes
   The longitudinal boost of the centre-of-mass frame in hadronic
   collisions is correctly accounted for now.

** Numerical stability fixes 
   Small fixes in RunningMass and QTildeReconstructor.

** Powheg example input files
   The example input files for Powheg processes now set the NLO
   alpha_S correctly, and are run as part of 'make check'.

** OS X builds for Snow Leopard
   Snow Leopard machines will now be recognized as a 64bit
   architecture.

** Uses ThePEG-1.6.0 
   Herwig++ now requires ThePEG-1.6.0 to benefit from the improved
   helicity code there. If you have self-written vertex classes, see
   ThePEG's NEWS file for conversion instructions.

** Vertex improvements
   ThePEG's new helicity code allowed major simplification of the vertex
   implementations for all Standard Model and BSM physics models.

** New Transplanckian scattering model
   An example configuration is in LHC-TRP.in

** BSM ModelGenerator as branching ratio calculator
   The BSM ModelGenerator has a new switch to output the branching

   - sHat (default for colour neutral intermediates) and 
   - transverse mass (default for all other processes).

** Ticket #287: Powheg process scale choice
   The default choice is now the mass of the colour-singlet system.
   
** Ticket #278: QED radiation for BSM
   Soft QED radiation is now enabled in BSM decays and all
   perturbative decays by default. 

** Ticket #279: Full 1-loop QED radiation for Z decays
   Soft QED radiation in Z decays is now fully 1-loop by default.

** Ticket #280: Redirect all files to stdout
   This is now implemented globally. The files previously ending in
   -UE.out and -BSMinfo.out are now appended to the log file. They now
   also obey the EventGenerator:UseStdout flag.

** Ticket #270: LaTeX output updated
   After each run, a LaTeX file is produced that contains the full
   list of citations. Please include the relevant ones in publications.

** Ticket #256: Mac OS X problems
   An initialization problem that affected only some configurations has
   been identified and fixed.

* Herwig++-2.4.0 release: 2009-09-01 (tagged at SVN r4616)

** New matrix elements
   We have added a built-in implementation of several new matrix elements:
   PP --> WW / WZ / ZZ
   PP --> W gamma / Z gamma
   PP --> VBF Higgs
   PP --> Higgs tt / Higgs bb
   e+e- --> WW / ZZ

    'configure' run and in the file 'config.thepeg'. Please provide
    this file in any bug reports.

*** New ZERO object
    The ZERO object can be used to set any dimensionful quantity to
    zero. This avoids explicit constructs like 0.0*GeV.

*** Exception specifiers removed
    Client code changes are needed in doinit() etc., simply remove the
    exception specifier after the function name.

*** Ticket #263: Tau polarizations can be forced in TauDecayer





* Herwig++-2.3.2 release: 2009-05-08 (tagged at SVN r4249)

* Herwig++-2.3.1 release: 2009-03-31 (tagged at SVN r4140)
** Initial state showers
   The PDF veto was wrongly applied to qbar->qbar g splittings.

** User interaction
   The Makefile-UserModules now includes the Herwig version number.
   The -N flag to 'Herwig++ run' is optional now, as was always intended.

** Contrib
   The contrib directory is now included in the tarball. The omission
   was accidental.

** Numerical accuracy
   Minor problems with values close to zero were fixed in several
   locations.

** LEP event shapes
   An accidental duplication was removed, they are now only calculated
   once per event.

* Herwig++-2.3.0 release: 2008-12-02 (tagged at SVN r3939)
** Major release, with many new features and bug fixes

** Extension to lepton-hadron collisions

** Inclusion of several processes accurate at next-to-leading order
   in the POsitive Weight Hardest Emission Generator (POWHEG) scheme

** Inclusion of three-body decays and finite-width effects
   in BSM processes

** New procedure for reconstructing kinematics of the parton shower
   based on the colour structure of the hard scattering process

** New model for baryon decays including excited baryon multiplets

** Addition of a soft component to the multiple scattering model
   of the underlying event and the option to choose more than one hard
   scattering explicitly

** New matrix elements for DIS and e+e- processes

** New /Contrib directory added
   containing external modules that will hopefully be of use to some
   users but are not expected to be needed by most users and are not
   supported at the same level as the main Herwig++ code

** Minor changes to improve the physics simulation:

*** IncomingPhotonEvolver added
    to allow the simulation of partonic processes with incoming photons
    in hadron collisions

*** KTRapidityCut added
    to allow cuts on the p_T and rapidity, rather than just the p_T and
    pseudorapidity used in SimpleKTCut. This is now used by default for
    cuts on massive particles such as the $W^\pm$, $Z^0$ and Higgs
    bosons and the top quark

*** Several changes to the decayers of B mesons
    both to resolve problems with the modelling of partonic decays and
    improve agreement with $\Upsilon(4s)$ data

*** Changes to allow values other than transverse mass of final-state particles as maximum transverse momentum for radiation in parton shower
    either SCALUP for Les Houches events or the scale of the hard
    process for internally generated hard processes

*** Changed defaults for intrinsic transverse momentum in hadron collisions
    to 1.9GeV, 2.1GeV and 2.2GeV for the Tevatron and LHC at 10 TeV and
    14 TeV, respectively

*** Pdfinfo object is now created in the HepMC interface
    However in order to support all versions of HepMC containing this
    feature the PDF set is not specified as not all versions contain
    this information

*** New option of only decaying particles with lifetimes below user specified value

*** New options for the cut-off in the shower
    and some obsolete parameters removed

*** Added option of switching off certain decay modes in BSM models

*** Added a Matcher for Higgs boson
    to allow cuts to be placed on it

*** Diffractive particles deleted from default input files
    they were not previously used

** Technical changes:

*** Some AnalysisHandler classes comparing to LEP data have been renamed
    e.g. MultiplicityCount becomes LEPMultiplicityCount to avoid
    confusion with those supplied in /Contrib for observables at the
    Upsilon(4s) resonance

*** Reorganisation to remove the majority of the .icc files
    by moving inlined functions to headers in an effort to improve
    compile time

*** Restructured the decay libraries to reduce the amount of memory allocation
    and de-allocation which improves run-time performance

*** The switch to turn off LoopTools has been removed
    because LoopTools is now used by several core modules. As LoopTools
    does not work on 64-bit platforms with g77 this build option is not
    supported

*** Removed support for obsolete version of HepMC supplied with CLHEP
    and improved the support for different units options with HepMC

*** EvtGen interface has been removed until it is more stable

*** Support for ROOT has been removed
    it was not previously used

*** CKKW infrastructure has been removed from the release
    until a concrete implementation is available

*** Default optimisation has been increased from -O2 to -O3

*** Handling of the fortran compiler has been improved
    mainly due to improvements in the autotools

*** Use of FixedAllocator for Particle objects in ThePEG has been removed
    as it had no performance benefits

** Bugs fixed:

*** Problems with the mother/daughter relations in the hard process
    and diagram selection in W+- and Z0 production in association with a
    hard jet

*** In general matrix element code for fermion-vector to fermion-scalar
    where the outgoing fermion is coloured and the scalar neutral

*** In the selection of diagrams in some associated squark gaugino processes

*** h0->mu+mu- was being generated when h0->tau+tau-

*** Normalisation in the Histogram class for non unit-weight events

*** Protection against negative PDF values has been improved
    these can occur when using NLO PDF sets

*** Lifetime for BSM particles is now automatically calculated
    at the same time as the width

*** Hadrons containing a top quark now treated like hadrons containing BSM particles
    in order to support this possibility

*** Several ambiguous uses of unsigned int

*** Several variables that may have been used undefined

*** Several memory leaks at initialisation

*** The configuration now aborts if no fortran compiler is found
    as this is required to compile Looptools

*** Several minor floating point errors that did not affect results

** Ticket #140 / #141: Crash on shutdown
   Event generation from the 'read' stage or an interface now shuts
   down cleanly. Fixes a crash bug introduced in 2.1.1 which affected
   external APIs to ThePEG / Herwig.

** Ticket #146: BSM models can be disabled
   To save build time, some or all of the BSM models can be disabled
   using the '--enable-models' configure switch.

** Reorganised .model files
   The .model files now include the model-specific particles, too.

** Re-tune
   Re-tuned hadronization parameters to LEP data. 

** Other fixes in
   QSPAC implementation in Shower; Multi-parton interaction tuning;
   MRST initialization




* Herwig++-2.1.2 release: 2008-01-05 (tagged at SVN r2694)
** Ticket #127
   Thanks to a patch submitted by Fred Stober, HepMCFile now can
   output event files in all supported formats. 

** Ticket #128
   Fixed incorrect value of pi in histogram limits.

** Other fixes in
   CKKW Qtilde clusterers, BSM width cut, SUSY mixing matrices.




* Herwig++-2.1.1 release: 2007-12-08 (tagged at SVN r2589)
** Bug #123
   Fixed a bug with particle lifetimes which resulted in nan for some
   vertex positions.

** Secondary scatters
   Fixed bug which gave intrinsic pT to secondary scatters.

** gcc abs bug detection
   configure now checks for and works around
   http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34130

** CKKW reweighting
   Fixed wrong check for top quarks.

** MPIHandler
   Fixed call order ambiguity.
