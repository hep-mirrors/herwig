Herwig++ News				(emacs -*- outline -*- format)

* Herwig++-2.2.0 release: 2008-04-18 (tagged at SVN r3195)
** Major release: now as stand-alone library
   Herwig++ is now a stand-alone dlopen() plugin to ThePEG.
   No compile-time linking to Herwig code is required. The Herwig++
   binary is a simple executable steering ThePEG, which can
   be replaced by other frontends (such as setupThePEG / runThePEG).  

** New matrix elements
   p p   -> W + jet / Z + jet / W + higgs / Z + higgs
   e+ e- -> Z + higgs

** Looptools 
   Updated to version 2.2.

** Ticket #141: segfault from using 'run' command
   Fixed by using default allocators in Herwig++, and the
   Repository::cleanup() method in ThePEG 1.2.0. 

** Ticket #157: broken gsl library path on some 64bit systems
   Paths with lib64 are correctly identified now.

** Ticket #159: p_t spectrum of ttbar pair
   Fixed identical particle multiplier in Sudakov form factor.

** Ticket #161: glibc segfault
   Rare segfault in MPI handler fixed.

** Ticket #165: rare infinite loop in four-body decay
   All 4-body decays without dedicated decayers now use the Mambo algorithm.
   A loop guard has been introduced to 3-body decays to avoid infinite retries.

** Ticket #166: rare infinite loop in top ME correction
   These very rare events (O(1) in 10^7) close to mass threshold
   now are discarded.

** Higgs width fixes

** SatPDF
   Optionally, the PDF extrapolation behaviour outside a given range 
   can now be specified.

** gcc 4.3
   Herwig++-2.2 compiles cleanly with the new gcc 4.3 series.




* Herwig++-2.1.4 release: 2008-03-03 (tagged at SVN r3024)
** Ticket #152: Vertex positions
   All vertex positions of unphysical particles are set to zero until
   a fix for the previous nonsensical values can be implemented.




* Herwig++-2.1.3 release: 2008-02-25 (tagged at SVN r2957)
** Ticket #129: Baryon decays
   Fix for baryon decay modes.

** Ticket #131: HepMC
   Check if IO_GenEvent exists

** Ticket #134: Hadronization
   Smearing of hadron directions in cluster decay fixed.

** Ticket #137: HepMC
   HepMC conversion allows specification of energy and length units to
   be used. 

** Ticket #139: Neutral kaons
   Ratio K_L / K_S corrected.

** Ticket #140 / #141: Crash on shutdown
   Event generation from the 'read' stage or an interface now shuts
   down cleanly. Fixes a crash bug introduced in 2.1.1 which affected
   external APIs to ThePEG / Herwig.

** Ticket #146: BSM models can be disabled
   To save build time, some or all of the BSM models can be disabled
   using the '--enable-models' configure switch.

** Reorganised .model files
   The .model files now include the model-specific particles, too.

** Re-tune
   Re-tuned hadronization parameters to LEP data. 

** Other fixes in
   QSPAC implementation in Shower; Multi-parton interaction tuning;
   MRST initialization




* Herwig++-2.1.2 release: 2008-01-05 (tagged at SVN r2694)
** Ticket #127
   Thanks to a patch submitted by Fred Stober, HepMCFile now can
   output event files in all supported formats. 

** Ticket #128
   Fixed incorrect value of pi in histogram limits.

** Other fixes in
   CKKW Qtilde clusterers, BSM width cut, SUSY mixing matrices.




* Herwig++-2.1.1 release: 2007-12-08 (tagged at SVN r2589)
** Bug #123
   Fixed a bug with particle lifetimes which resulted in nan for some
   vertex positions.

** Secondary scatters
   Fixed bug which gave intrinsic pT to secondary scatters.

** gcc abs bug detection
   configure now checks for and works around
   http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34130

** CKKW reweighting
   Fixed wrong check for top quarks.

** MPIHandler
   Fixed call order ambiguity.




* Herwig++-2.1.0 release: 2007-11-20 (tagged at SVN r2542)
** Major new release
   Herwig++-2.1 includes significant improvements, including
   multi-parton interactions, BSM physics and a new hadronic decay
   model, tuned to LEP data.
