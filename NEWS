* Herwig++-2.3.0 release: 2008-11-28 (tagged at SVN r????)
** Major release, with many new features and bug fixes

** Extension to lepton-hadron collisions

** Inclusion of several processes accurate at next-to-leading order
   in the POsitive Weight Hardest Emission Generator (POWHEG) scheme

** Inclusion of three-body decays and finite-width effects
   in BSM processes

** New procedure for reconstructing kinematics of the parton shower
   based on the colour structure of the hard scattering process

** New model for baryon decays including excited baryon multiplets

** Addition of a soft component to the multiple scattering model
   of the underlying event and the option to choose more than one hard
   scattering explicitly

** New matrix elements for DIS and e+e- processes

** New /Contrib directory added
   containing external modules that will hopefully be of use to some
   users but are not expected to be needed by most users and are not
   supported at the same level as the main Herwig++ code

** Minor changes to improve the physics simulation:

*** IncomingPhotonEvolver added
    to allow the simulation of partonic processes with incoming photons
    in hadron collisions

*** KTRapidityCut added
    to allow cuts on the p_T and rapidity, rather than just the p_T and
    pseudorapidity used in SimpleKTCut. This is now used by default for
    cuts on massive particles such as the $W^\pm$, $Z^0$ and Higgs
    bosons and the top quark

*** Several changes to the decayers of B mesons
    both to resolve problems with the modelling of partonic decays and
    improve agreement with $\Upsilon(4s)$ data

*** Changes to allow values other than transverse mass of final-state particles as maximum transverse momentum for radiation in parton shower
    either SCALUP for Les Houches events or the scale of the hard
    process for internally generated hard processes

*** Changed defaults for intrinsic transverse momentum in hadron collisions
    to 1.9GeV, 2.1GeV and 2.2GeV for the Tevatron and LHC at 10 TeV and
    14 TeV, respectively

*** Pdfinfo object is now created in the HepMC interface
    However in order to support all versions of HepMC containing this
    feature the PDF set is not specified as not all versions contain
    this information

*** New option of only decaying particles with lifetimes below user specified value

*** New options for the cut-off in the shower
    and some obsolete parameters removed

*** Added option of switching off certain decay modes in BSM models

*** Added a Matcher for Higgs boson
    to allow cuts to be placed on it

*** Diffractive particles deleted from default input files
    they were not previously used

** Technical changes:

*** Some AnalysisHandler classes comparing to LEP data have been renamed
    e.g. MultiplicityCount becomes LEPMultiplicityCount to avoid
    confusion with those supplied in /Contrib for observables at the
    Upsilon(4s) resonance

*** Reorganisation to remove the majority of the .icc files
    by moving inlined functions to headers in an effort to improve
    compile time

*** Restructured the decay libraries to reduce the amount of memory allocation
    and de-allocation which improves run-time performance

*** The switch to turn off LoopTools has been removed
    because LoopTools is now used by several core modules. As LoopTools
    does not work on 64-bit platforms with g77 this build option is not
    supported

*** Removed support for obsolete version of HepMC supplied with CLHEP
    and improved the support for different units options with HepMC

*** EvtGen interface has been removed until it is more stable

*** Support for ROOT has been removed
    it was not previously used

*** CKKW infrastructure has been removed from the release
    until a concrete implementation is available

*** Default optimisation has been increased from -O2 to -O3

*** Handling of the fortran compiler has been improved
    mainly due to improvements in the autotools

*** Use of FixedAllocator for Particle objects in ThePEG has been removed
    as it had no performance benefits

** Bugs fixed:

*** Problems with the mother/daughter relations in the hard process
    and diagram selection in W+- and Z0 production in association with a
    hard jet

*** In general matrix element code for fermion-vector to fermion-scalar
    where the outgoing fermion is coloured and the scalar neutral

*** In the selection of diagrams in some associated squark gaugino processes

*** h0->mu+mu- was being generated when h0->tau+tau-

*** Normalisation in the Histogram class for non unit-weight events

*** Protection against negative PDF values has been improved
    these can occur when using NLO PDF sets

*** Lifetime for BSM particles is now automatically calculated
    at the same time as the width

*** Hadrons containing a top quark now treated like hadrons containing BSM particles
    in order to support this possibility

*** Several ambiguous uses of unsigned int

*** Several variables that may have been used undefined

*** Several memory leaks at initialisation

*** The configuration now aborts if no fortran compiler is found
    as this is required to compile Looptools

*** Several minor floating point errors that did not affect results



* Herwig++-2.2.1 release: 2008-07-09 (tagged at SVN r3434)
** Ticket #181: BSM shower with a decay close to threshold
   Now fixed.

** Ticket #191: Split SUSY crash
   Improved error message. 

** Ticket #192: using SCALUP as the pT veto in the shower
   Now implemented.

** Ticket #194: production processes of ~chi_1(2)-
   Fixed bug in the diagram creation.

** Removed unused particles
   DiffractiveParticles.in was removed, they were never produced.

** Hadronization
   Top quark clusters now possible, handled as 'exotic' clusters.

** Improved handling of decay modes
   See ThePEG-1.3.0. 'defaultparticle' command is now obsolete. 

** Multi-Parton interactions
   Increased phase space sampling to have less than 1% uncertainty on
   average multiplicity.

** New libtool version
   gfortran is now used as default if it is available. Set FC=g77 to
   override this. 

** Fixed several memory leaks

** Memory allocation
   Now using plain 'new' and 'delete'.


* Herwig++-2.2.0 release: 2008-04-18 (tagged at SVN r3195)
** Major release: now as stand-alone library
   Herwig++ is now a stand-alone dlopen() plugin to ThePEG.
   No compile-time linking to Herwig code is required. The Herwig++
   binary is a simple executable steering ThePEG, which can
   be replaced by other frontends (such as setupThePEG / runThePEG).  

** New matrix elements
   p p   -> W + jet / Z + jet / W + higgs / Z + higgs
   e+ e- -> Z + higgs

** Looptools 
   Updated to version 2.2.

** Ticket #141: segfault from using 'run' command
   Fixed by using default allocators in Herwig++, and the
   Repository::cleanup() method in ThePEG 1.2.0. 

** Ticket #157: broken gsl library path on some 64bit systems
   Paths with lib64 are correctly identified now.

** Ticket #159: p_t spectrum of ttbar pair
   Fixed identical particle multiplier in Sudakov form factor.

** Ticket #161: glibc segfault
   Rare segfault in MPI handler fixed.

** Ticket #165: rare infinite loop in four-body decay
   All 4-body decays without dedicated decayers now use the Mambo algorithm.
   A loop guard has been introduced to 3-body decays to avoid infinite retries.

** Ticket #166: rare infinite loop in top ME correction
   These very rare events (O(1) in 10^7) close to mass threshold
   now are discarded.

** Higgs width fixes

** SatPDF
   Optionally, the PDF extrapolation behaviour outside a given range 
   can now be specified.

** gcc 4.3
   Herwig++-2.2 compiles cleanly with the new gcc 4.3 series.




* Herwig++-2.1.4 release: 2008-03-03 (tagged at SVN r3024)

   All vertex positions of unphysical particles are set to zero until
   a fix for the previous nonsensical values can be implemented.

** Ticket #129: Baryon decays
   Fix for baryon decay modes.

** Ticket #131: HepMC
   Check if IO_GenEvent exists

** Ticket #134: Hadronization

   down cleanly. Fixes a crash bug introduced in 2.1.1 which affected
   external APIs to ThePEG / Herwig.

** Ticket #146: BSM models can be disabled
   To save build time, some or all of the BSM models can be disabled
   using the '--enable-models' configure switch.

** Reorganised .model files
   The .model files now include the model-specific particles, too.

** Re-tune
   Re-tuned hadronization parameters to LEP data.

   MRST initialization




* Herwig++-2.1.2 release: 2008-01-05 (tagged at SVN r2694)

   output event files in all supported formats.
