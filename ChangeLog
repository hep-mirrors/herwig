	* Decay: changes to many classes due to the new base class 
	
	* Hadronization changes to tidy up the PartonicHadronizer and allow the
	hadronization to produce off-shell particles.
	
	* Decay/HwDecayerBase.h (Repository): added new base class for decayers including
	the Initialize feature of the DecayIntegrator and dataBaseOutput so this can be
	used for classes not built on DecayIntegrator.

	* PDT/GenericWidthGenerator.h: changes so that the mass generator only includes
	the numerator factor when generating a mass without the weight to avoid biases
	towards high masses.

	* Decay/DecayConfig.h (Repository): this was really the .fh file for Hw64Decayer
	and has been renamed as such.

	* Decay/ExampleDecayer (Repository): removed the ExampleDecayer as it served
	little purpose and should be replaced by information on the Wiki.

2005-09-08  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* src/HerwigDefaults.in (Repository): changes for the new treatment of hadronization in partonic decays

	* Decay/Baryon/SU3BaryonDecupletOctetPhotonDecayer.cc (Repository): various minor bug fixes to the decays

2005-09-08  David Grellscheid  <dgrell@d2.phyip3.dur.ac.uk>

	* lib/Makefile.am: added libHwPartonicDecay.la to the list of libraries

2005-09-05  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* Utilities/HerwigRun.cc: changes to documentation to remove some doxygen errors and more changes due to change in random numbers from ThePEG

2005-09-04  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* Doc/tagfileThePEG.tag (Repository): changes to documentation so that include is not scanned by doxygen and duplicate base classes do not appear

	* Utilities/Kinematics.cc (Repository): Changes for the changes to random numbers from ThePEG and improvements to documentation

2005-09-01  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

2005-09-01  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* Decay/Partonic/BtoSGammaDecayer.fh (Repository): added new partonic decayers for b to s gamma and weak partonic decays

2005-09-01  Peter Richardson <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* Hadronization/PartonicHadronizer.h (Repository): added new class for hadronization of partonic b and c decays.

	* Hadronization/PartonSplitter.h (Repository): changes to the hadronization to ensure only the taggws particles are hadronized.

	* PDT/GenericWidthGenerator.icc (Repository): S->VV shape and naive running width option added

	* Decay/ScalarMeson/PScalarVectorFermionsDecayer.cc (Repository): various minor fixes to the decay classes.

	* Decay/ScalarMeson/ScalarVectorVectorDecayer.icc (Repository): added new decayer for S -> VV

	* Decay/Partonic (Repository): added files for b to s gamma hadronic mass spectra

2005-09-01  Peter Richardson  <Peter.Richardson@durham.ac.uk>

	* Helicity/WaveFunction/SpinorWaveFunction.icc (Repository): changes to helicity classes to move large inlined members to the .cc files

	* Makefile.am (Repository): Interfaces now made automatically

	* Decay/Partonic/QuarkoniumDecayer.icc (Repository): changes to move partonic decayers into a sperate directory

	* Decay/HeavyDecayer.icc (Repository): changes to move partonic decayers into a seperate directory
