This is a comparision tool for external Interfaces.


How to:

Define HEPMC and HERWIG paths in makefile. Then:

$make

Define a process in global.in with reasonable cuts.

$make check

This will build folders and compiles code if necessary.
Log-files are in the subfolders.

$make compare 

produces 100 events and compares the Interfaces which produced events in 'make check' 

$make clean 

removes the folders and hepmc.

$make clean_hepmc

removes hepmc.


To set AAA.hepmc to be the "Thuth.hepmc" type:

$make TRUTH=AAA.hepmc settruth
