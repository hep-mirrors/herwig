 (Last update: 12-Apr-2002)

 This directory contains classes derived from the abstract class
      Pythia7/MatrixElement/MEBase.h
 which represent hard 2->N subprocess matrix elements.
 These classes can be just stand-alone processes, or they can be
 the "plus jet" correction processes associated with the 
 matching of hard subprocesses with parton showers.
