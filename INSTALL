To install Herwig++ you must have ThePEG, CLHEP and gcc v3 or 
greater. Then set the environment variables CLHEPPATH and THEPEGPATH
to the location of the respected packages. If the includes are not
in CLHEPPATH/include or THEPEGPATH/include then also set the env
variables CLHEPINCLUDES and/or THEPEGINCLUDES to the appropriate
place. Currently, ThePEG libraries are required to be in 
THEPEGPATH/lib/ThePEG (the libCLHEP.so created by ThePEG should also
be in that directory). You may need to create a symbolic link at 
this location. The static CLHEP library should be in
CLHEPPATH/lib. Also, for building the KtJetInterface and the 
AmegicInterface libraries you must set AMEGICPATH and KTJETPATH 
variables and individually in the Interfaces directory compile 
the interfaces.

Then just type:

./configure
make
make check

This will run the Herwig++ init and Herwig++ read LEP.in commands.
If these don't core dump then the program is working properly and
the libraries have been created. make install will be implemented
and tested later.
