 (Last update: 12-Apr-2002)

 This directory contains classes derived from the abstract class
      Pythia7/PDT/Decayer.h
 which represent decay 1->N process matrix elements.
 These classes can be just stand-alone processes, or they can be
 the "plus jet" correction processes associated with the 
 matching of decay processes with parton showers.
