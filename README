 What you need:
 ==============

 --- Linux operating system;

 --- GNU C/C++ compiler  gcc  version  3.0.4

 --- CLHEP version 1.7.0.0  installed in:
                                           /your/first/choice/
     with subdirectories: ---   lib/  where there is libCLHEP.a
                          ---   include/CLHEP  where there is the source code

 --- Pythia7 (latest update) installed in:
                                           /your/second/choice/Pythia7


 Step to follow:
 ===============

  1)  Set the environmental variables:  CLHEPPATH , LD_LIBRARY_PATH , PYTHIA7PATH
      (and *NOT* instead modified configure.in)   as follows:

      > set  CLHEPPATH=/your/first/choice
      > set  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CLHEPPATH/lib
      > set  PYTHIA7PATH=/your/second/choice/

      NB) It can be that you have to specify also the compiler library:
          suppose it is in  /path/forgcc/lib/  then replace the above
          definition for LD_LIBRARY_PATH as follows:
            > set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/forgcc/lib/:$CLHEPPATH/lib/          

 2)  build Pythia7 : 

      % cd /your/second/choice/Pythia7/
      % make current


 3)  build Herwig++ :

      % cd /your/third/choice/Herwig++ 
      % make current

 4)  %  cd src

     %  setupHerwig.exe -init      
            ===> to build the repository  * HerwigDefaults.rpo *

     %  setupHerwig.exe SimpleLEP.in
            ===> to build the generator  * SimpleLEP.run *

     %  runHerwig.exe SimpleLEP.run
            ===> see the output in  * SimpleLEP.out *  and messages in 
                 the log file       * SimpleLEP.log *
                 If you want a long list of debugging information 
                 (which you can find in  SimpleLEP.log):
                     % runHerwig.exe -dHw n SimpleLEP.run
                 where n = 1  for moderate checking information
                       n = 10 for full debugging information
